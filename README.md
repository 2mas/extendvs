# Visual Studio Extensions

Visual Studio is a fully extensible development platform and  empowers you to extend almost every part:

* Add menu items and toolbars items that activate functionality you build
* Create tool windows that offer entirely new functionality
* Integrate new languages into the IDE
* Offer light bulbs that help developers write better code
* Integrate new project types into Visual Studio
